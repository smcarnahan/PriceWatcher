# PriceWatcher
An application that finds and tracks the current price of an item from a website. 
This application is still a work in progress, since it is a project that I am working on this semester.
I currently use a buffered reader to retrieve all information from a website. This is not a design choice,
since there are much more effective ways of doing this, but is a requirement for my class.
Websites that my application can grab information from currently are: Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Ebay, Dicks Sporting Goods, 
and will soon include Costco

I recommend downloading a DB browser for SQlite, you may find one at sqlitebrowser.org
This way you may see in realtime your objects stored in the database

When running the program, if you choose to check the price of an item, or delete an item, it will display the objects it retrieves
and compares. The reason I am displaying these values and items is to show you how the traversal of a database works.

Currently I am working on a GUI for the application, and it won't be availble for another few weeks.
But for now please enjoy the barebones price watcher! I cant wait to unveil the finished product soon!
Stay tuned!
